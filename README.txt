Tried to keep the printed output like in the example.
I noticed that the output is not konsistent and would be glad to have some
feedback about this issue. 

I think it has to do with the scheduler, but how can i force the prog to give
me a konsistent output?
Am i programming the wrong way?

Approximatly every 3er printingtry gets mixed up.
